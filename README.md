# PDFTools
A simple interactive python script for altering PDF files.

It should be fairly easy to understand just call the function you need!
- merge pdf1 pdf2: will create a new pdf by concatonating pdf2 to the end of pdf1 
- separate pdf1: will create a new pdf with one specified page of pdf1
- delete pdf1: will create a new pdf with the specifed page removed from pdf1

I build this script to attach the first page of my CO-OP work term report, to the actual report. 
I also did not want to install complex external software for such a simple task.

This tool could be improved in countless ways, maybe I will get there one day!
